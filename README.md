This is information about JSON:

About: "JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML."

JSON Keys and Values: "Key: A key is always a string enclosed in quotation marks." "Value: A value can be a string, number, boolean expression, array, or object." "Key/Value Pair: A key value pair follows a specific syntax, with the key #followed by a colon followed by the value. Key/value pairs are comma separated."

Types of values: "Array: An associative array of values." "Boolean: True or false." "Number: An integer." "Object: An associative array of key/value pairs." "String: Several plain text characters which usually form a word."
