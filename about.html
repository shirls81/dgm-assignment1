<h1>Some things about JSON</h1>
<h3>Disclaimer: I copied this off of W3 Schools</h3>
<p>Here is an example of JSON:</p>

{"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]}


<p>Here is an example of XML:</p>

<employees>
    <employee>
        <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Doe</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Anna</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Jones</lastName>
    </employee>
</employees>

Why is it important? Because it can interchange format that is used to transmit serialized information from a website. In other words it makes it easier for humans to read as objects or pairs.  


-JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
-JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
-JSON is language independent *
-JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
-JSON can be used with websites, Mobile applications, REST API's, Databases, and more.
-JSON is a collection of name value pairs.
-JSON can support four primative types:
	-Strings
    -Numbers
    -Booleans
    -Null    

* JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only, just like XML.
Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language.
